Skin Toolbox
============

Skin Toolbox is an interface that helps the design process of robot skins.  It was created during the ROBOSKIN project
in which a large scale modular robot skin was designed.  This software simulates and analyzes the design of these
triangular modules and patches that can be created from multiple modules, in terms of structural mechanics and
electrostatics.  With an integrated database of materials, the software also optimizes the choice of material to obtain
required attributes for the robot skin, such as weight and sensitivity.

This software is based on MATLAB and COMSOL Multiphysics.
